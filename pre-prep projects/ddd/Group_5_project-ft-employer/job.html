                <p>Willice Onyango, the Executive Director of The Youth Cafe has been honored to be one of the speakers at an online event: Democracy In East Africa In <br> The Wake Of The Coronavirus Pandemic: Challenges and Opportunities. The Youth Cafe is focusing on, The next generation and Youth inclusion in politics. East Africa is young in democracy and <br> its political institutions are not well established, youth are excluded from important decision-making processes. Governments and policymakers in East Africa are reluctant to <br> include youth in the formal political systems. What future do the youths want and how can they increase their participation in politics? <br> Some of the speakers are Former President of Nigeria Goodluck Jonathan, Former First lady of Mozambique Graca Machel, <br> and Ugandan Political and Human Rights Activist Kifefe Kizza-Besigye among others.

            <p>The aim of IYD 2020 is to shed light on the need to enable the engagement of youth by making local, national and global institutions more inclusive for the purpose of strengthening their capacity (and relevance) to achieve global action. In particular, IYD 2020 seeks to highlight the ways in which the engagement of young people at the local, national and global levels is enriching national and multilateral institutions and processes, as well as draw lessons on how their representation <br> and engagement in formal institutional politics can be significantly enhanced. This year’s IYD seeks to put the spotlight on youth engagement through the <br> following three interconnected streams: 1. Engagement at the local/community level; 2. Engagement at the <br> national level (formulation of laws, policies, and their implementation); and, 3. Engagement at the global level.</p>
